General Information About SPICE PC-Kernels
==========================================

   In the SPICE system, the PC-kernels contain planetary attitude and
   body shape information. The PCK kernel includes orientation and
   shape information pertaining to extended solar system bodies such as
   the Sun, the planets, the natural satellites of the planets, comets,
   and asteroids.

   The purpose of the PCK kernels and associated software is to provide
   SPICE users with a convenient mechanism for supplying planetary
   physical constants to application programs. SPICE's PCK software is
   able to read files conforming to the PCK format and return to a
   calling application program both the data contained in such files
   and a small number of commonly used numeric quantities derived from
   the kernel data. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE
   system toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is
   located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of
   this data set.

   Refer to the ``pck.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information on how to access PC-kernel data.


Clementine PC-kernels Contained in This Data Set
================================================

   The following PC-Kernel files are provided in this data set:
   
      pck00008.tpc                 the latest generic SPICE PCK file
                                   distributed by NAIF/JPL at the time
                                   when this archive was created. This
                                   file is based on the 2000 IAU
                                   constants.
 
      moon_pa_de403_1950_2198.bpc  PcK file containing high- accuracy
                                   lunar orientation data from the JPL
                                   Solar System Dynamics Group's
                                   planetary ephemeris DE-403. This
                                   kernel yields the orientation the
                                   the lunar principal axes (PA)
                                   reference frame (defined by DE-403)
                                   relative to the ICRF. Applications
                                   using this file will also need to
                                   load a generic lunar frame kernel
                                   also provided in this data set.


Kernel File Details
===================
 
   The most detailed description of the data in a text PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.
   
   The most detailed description of the data in a binary PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using utility programs COMMNT and
   SPACIT included into the NAIF Toolkit.
