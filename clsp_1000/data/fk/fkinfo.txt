General Information About SPICE Frames Kernels
==============================================

   In the SPICE system, Frames kernel contains a set of information
   required to define various frames used in a particular mission,
   sources of orientation and origin location information for these
   frames and inter-connections between these frames and other frames
   supported within the SPICE system.

   The frame definitions information contained in the file can be
   utilized in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit
   APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   Refer to the ``frames.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about definition and usage of the frames within the
   SPICE system.


Clementine Frames Kernels Contained in This Data Set
====================================================

   The following Frames Kernel files are included in this data set
   (only name portion of the file name is shown on the right; the
   extension of all file names is ``.tf''):

   Clementine Mission Frames Kernels:

      clem_vVV       main Clementine FK file(s) providing the complete
                     set of frame definitions for the Clementine
                     spacecraft and its science instruments.

   Generic Moon Frames Kernels:

      moon_060721    Lunar FK file specifying lunar body-fixed frames
                     for use by SPICE-based applications

      moon_assoc_me  Lunar FK file directing the SPICE system to
                     associate the lunar "mean Earth" reference frame,
                     MOON_ME, with the Moon


      moon_assoc_pa  Lunar FK file directing the SPICE system to
                     associate the lunar "principal axis" reference
                     frame, MOON_PA, with the Moon.

   If multiple FK files of the same kind are present, the one with the
   latest version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an FK file is provided
   in metadata included inside the description area of the file. This
   information can be viewed using any text editor program.
