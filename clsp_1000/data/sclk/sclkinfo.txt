General Information About SPICE SCL-Kernels
===========================================

   In the SPICE system, Spacecraft Clock (or SCL) -kernel contains a
   set of information required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).

   The spacecraft clock coefficient information contained in SCLK file
   can be manipulated using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to which can
   be integrated into user application programs. The information
   regarding how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a number of
   languages and computer platforms is located in the ``/software''
   subdirectory of the main directory of this data set.

   Refer to the ``sclk.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about conversion between ET and spacecraft clock
   times.


Clementine SCL-kernels Contained in This Data Set
=================================================

   This data set includes a single Clementine SCLK kernel

      clem_nom.tsc
 
   providing the nominal Clementine on-board clock to ET mapping.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an SCLK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.
