General Information About SPICE C-Kernels
=========================================

   In the SPICE system, pointing data for an instrument platform, or
   for a specific instrument, are stored C-kernels. The pointing of a
   platform or an instrument is often expressed in terms of a
   transformation matrix from some standard inertial reference frame to
   a instrument-fixed frame. In the past, the instrument was often a
   camera, and the transformation was thus dubbed the ``C-matrix'';
   hence the choice of C as the name for the pointing kernel.
   
   The data contained in C-kernel files can be accessed and manipulated
   using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to which can be integrated into
   user application programs. The information regarding how to obtain
   the SPICE system toolkit for a number of languages and computer
   platforms is located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main
   directory of this data set.
   
   To use C-kernels, a Spacecraft Clock Kernel (SCLK) is required.
   Also, for C-Kernels containing orientation of a project-defined
   frames, a Frame Definitions File is required.
   
   Refer to the ``ck.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information on how to access C-kernel data.


Clementine C-Kernels Contained in This Data Set
===============================================

   The following Clementine C-kernels are provided in this data set
   (only name portion of the file name is shown; the extension of all
   file names is ``.bc''):

      clem_act_ck3   CK file providing the actual orientation of the
                     Clementine spacecraft bus based on the SPQ files
                     produced during the mission by the spacecraft
                     team, NRL


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in a binary CK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using utility programs COMMNT and
   SPACIT included into the NAIF Toolkit.
