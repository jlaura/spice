General Information About SPICE I-Kernels
=========================================

   In the SPICE system, I-kernels contain field-of-view specifications,
   internal timing parameters, detector geometry specifications and
   other geometric parameters for the instrument. These parameters
   along with knowledge of the spacecraft pointing (C kernel) and
   instrument mounting alignment (Frames Kernel) allow the user to use
   SPICE APIs to calculate the view directions of the individual
   instrument pixels or detectors.

   The data contained in I-kernel files can be accessed and manipulated
   in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to
   which can be integrated into user application programs. The
   information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a
   number of languages and computer platforms is located in the
   ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data set.

   Refer to the ``kernel.req'' document provided with the Toolkit to get
   more information on how to access I-kernel data.


Clementine I-kernels Provided in This Data Set

                       the instrument
 
      clem_lwir_VER    IK file(s) for Long Wavelength Infrared Mapping
                       Spectrometer providing FOV definition and other
                       geometric parameters for the instrument
 
      clem_nir_VER     IK file(s) for  Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
                       (NIR) providing FOV definition and other
                       geometric parameters for the instrument
 
      clem_uvvis_VER   IK file(s) for Ultraviolet and Visible Imaging
                       Camera (UVVIS) providing FOV definition and

   If this data set contains multiple IK files for a particular
   instrument, the one with the latest version (VER) supersedes all
   previous versions.
