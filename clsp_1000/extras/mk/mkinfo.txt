Meta-kernels for the Clementine Mission
=======================================

   This directory contains the meta-kernel files (a.k.a ``furnsh''
   files) that provide lists of the archived kernels included in this
   data set suitable for loading into a SPICE-based application via the
   high level SPICE data loader routine FURNSH. Using these
   meta-kernels makes it easy to load with one call a comprehensive
   SPICE data collection for the whole mission. Like the text kernels
   archived in this data set, these meta-kernels are UNIX text files
   that have lines terminated with a line feed character, LF (ASCII
   10).

   The names of the meta-kernels provided in this directory follow this
   pattern:

      clem_vVV.tm

   where ``VV'' is the file version.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel may exist if new kernels were
   added to the archive in a later release and the meta-kernel had
   to be updated to incorporate them. The reasons for adding new
   kernels include (but are not limited to) adding new kinds of
   kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels containing more
   complete or more accurate data, and adding new versions of existing
   kernels superseding the existing kernels that had errors. If more
   than one meta-kernel file is present, then the file with the latest 
   version number supersedes all earlier versions.
 
   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the root directory of the data set -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to './data' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the data set's 'data' directory on their
   system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in all
   path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.
 
   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCKs, CKs, SCLK, IKs, and
         mission and lunar FKs were included

      -  the Lunar ME Reference Frame/Body Association Kernel was
         included to direct the SPICE system to associate the lunar
         "mean Earth" reference frame 'MOON_ME' with the Moon

      -  both the JPL and NRL spacecraft trajectory SPKs were included
         with the JPL SPK taking precedence (listed last) and NRL SPK
         having lower priority and used when the JPL SPK does not
         provide coverage
 
      -  no EK files were included due to the low likelihood that EKs
         would be needed for a SPICE-based application using the
         Clementine SPICE data
