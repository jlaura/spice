Orbit Number Files for the Clementine Mission
=============================================

   This directory contains an orbit number file "clem.orb" generated
   using the NAIF's ORBNUM utility program for the archived spacecraft
   trajectory SPK file "clem_jpl.bsp" produced by the Solar System
   Dynamics group, JPL. This orbnum file is a plain ASCII text file
   that has lines terminated with a line feed character, LF (ASCII 10).

   This file provides the orbit numbers that follow the
   "periapsis-to-periapsis" orbit numbering scheme -- with the orbit
   number changing at periapsis. Note this convention is different from
   the "south pole crossing" convention used during mission operations.
   Due to that the orbit starts defined by this file occur later than
   those defined by the south pole flyovers.
 
   The information contained in this orbit number file includes the
   orbit number ("No."), periapsis UTC time ("Periapsis UTC") and SCLK
   time ("Periapsis SCLK"), planetocentric subsolar longitude and
   latitude ("SolLon" and "SolLat") in the Moon body-fixed frame based
   on the DE 245 high precision Moon rotation data, planetocentric
   subspacecraft longitude and latitude ("SC Lon" and "SC Lat") in the
   same frame, and spacecraft altitude above Moon ("Alt") relative to
   1737.4 km spherical Moon surface.
