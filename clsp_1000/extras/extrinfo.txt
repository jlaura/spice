Extra Data Related to the Clementine Mission
============================================

   This directory contains value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Items included in this
   directory are currently limited to the meta-kernels and orbit number
   files. 

   The meta-kernels provided in the ``mk'' subdirectory contain
   complete lists the SPICE kernels in the format required by the main
   SPICE data loader routine FURNSH that need to be loaded into a
   SPICE-based application to compute geometry for a particular time
   period. For more information about the meta-kernels provided on this
   volume, see file ``mk/mkinfo.txt''.
 
   The orbit number files included in the ``orbnum'' subdirectory
   provide the orbit numbers and start times along with a small set of
   derived geometric parameters for each orbit. These files were
   generated during the mission using the NAIF's ORBNUM utility program
   for some of the final merged spacecraft trajectory SPK files for the
   orbital phases of the mission. For more information about the orbit
   number files provided on this volume, see file
   ``orbnum/orbinfo.txt''.
